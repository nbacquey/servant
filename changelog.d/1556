synopsis: Display capture hints in router layout
prs: #1556

description: {

This PR introduces a CaptureHint type, which is passed as an extra argument to the CaptureRouter and CaptureAllRouter constructors for the Router' type.
CaptureHint values are then used in routerLayout, to display the name and type of captured values, instead of just <capture> previously.

N.B.:
Because the choice smart constructor for routers can aggregate Capture combinators with different capture hints, the Capture*Router constructors actually take a list of CaptureHint, instead of a single one.

This PR also introduces Spec tests for the routerLayout function.
